# React Pager

Simple component that handles the business logic of navigating paginated content and leaves rendering to the user.

Inspired by Kent C. Dodd's [amazing course on advanced React component patterns](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns) on Egghead.io.

This is just a quick first pass written after I was so excited by what I learned in Kent's course. Proper module bundling, documentation, and more examples to come.
